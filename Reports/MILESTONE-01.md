## Objectives

- **Research and Analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive study on liquidity issues in Cardano, detailing the challenges faced by large volume trades on DEXs.
- **Project Plan Document**: A detailed public document outlining the project's objectives, scope, timeline, and deliverables. This document should clearly present how the project will proceed from research findings to implementation.
- **Functional Documentation**: Develop documentation that describes the Trustless OTC Smart Contract's concept, including its architecture. This includes:
  - An overview of the protocol architecture.
  - Descriptions of the smart contract functions, data structures, and interaction flows.
- **Use Cases and Benefits**: Outline potential applications of the smart contracts within the Cardano ecosystem. This section will detail how the solution addresses specific liquidity challenges and its benefits for different user groups.

## Achievements

- The research report has been completed and published, highlighting the key liquidity issues and proposing potential solutions.
- The project plan document has been drafted, providing a clear roadmap for the development and implementation of the OTC solution.
- Initial functional documentation of the smart contracts has been prepared, outlining the basic architecture and describing how the OTC mechanism will operate.
- Detailed plans, and the proposed architecture are documented in the main README for easy reference. See the [Main README](../README.md) for more information.

## Next Steps

- Continue refining the functional documentation with more detailed architecture and flow diagrams.
- Begin the development phase, implementing the core functionalities of the OTC smart contracts.
